This folder contains three notebooks. Notebook 1 shows how to align grains and provides tools to align a whole dataset almost automatically. Notebook 2 shows how to decompose a grain surface using spherical harmonics and how to recompose these grains using a base mesh. Notebook 2 needs the aligned dataset created by Notebook 1, so they should be run sequentially at least once. Notebook 3 trains neural network models using spherical harmonics coefficients as inputs. This notebooks also allows to use other data representations such as old_school dataset.
